<p>what’s the point of a blog? what would be it for? why this old boomer tactics? questions are several but this might be different apart from others maybe .. well lets see. apart from our daily life some should be documented which are worth to look behind after the chase. me as a tech-zoomer tries best to make updates regarding privacy security and other basic facts which therefore everyone will concur so far. not a tech-fancy website but the eyes to lookup for parting from the gnutards and tech-biased neighbours that makes you question youself and slowly homeless. the part of hitting the cyberpunk dystopian nightmares of the tech giants from one side we should focus on the other side as well. don’t be blind and stupid enough to be fooled but question every instincts when consumed !</p>
